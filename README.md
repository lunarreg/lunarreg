<!Hello, I would like to create a branch for the creation of customer service software in automotive workshops that work with body shop and car refinishing.
I am currently learning Wordpress, Algorithms, Logic, PHP, HTML, MySQL, CSS and Java Script.
I am looking to make a page on my website 'compraremplataformas' to share clients that are being served by me in body shop and refinish workshops.
How do I start? Do I create a branch or a repository? I want to give you the name 'Customer Service Dilondomartelin
If anyone can help me I will be grateful.>
